# Liquid Prism (ESP32 Board)

**_Bluetooth scanner for ESP32 board. This code allows the esp32 board to scan Bluetooth devices nearby and transmits a command to the Teensy board through i2C._**

## Introduction

This work is an artistic research and experiment about dependent origination. According to this notion, a single event or being reflects only a fragment of the whole world and time, so that we can approximate a closer picture of the complex interconnection between every entity and its dependency by reassembling pieces of the whole.

We are only seeing a part of the surroundings we live through. This experienced world is composed not only of ourselves but also of the unnoticed beings that surround us. Machines cover our living spaces and communicate with each other, yet we don't perceive their existence since machines are concealed, and use different language from ours. Therefore, we consider them not worthy to pay attention until they are not working properly. This apathy makes us difficult to draw the whole picture of the moment we are experiencing.

## Interaction diagram
This device produces the laser projection triggered by the Bluetooth signals nearby and reveals imperceptible but surely existing communication between machines that construct the moment in the area. When the audience reacts to the sound and laser pattern, the machine stops producing signals and becomes quiet. Only when people stop engaging and become silent and calm does the machine start talking.
