# Liquid Prism (ESP32 Board)

**_Bluetooth scanner for ESP32 board. This code allows the esp32 board to scan Bluetooth devices nearby and transmits a command to the Teensy board through i2C._**

## Introduction

Liquid Prism is a laboratory-like instrument that measures the subtle nuances of the liquid in several test tubes and its movements and changes due to chemical interactions with aspirin and other substances. The reactions, including bubbles, that occur during the melting process are converted into audio-visual data by an integrated laser beam and piezo sensors and can thus be experienced.

## Interaction diagram
This device produces the laser projection triggered by the Bluetooth signals nearby and reveals imperceptible but surely existing communication between machines that construct the moment in the area. When the audience reacts to the sound and laser pattern, the machine stops producing signals and becomes quiet. Only when people stop engaging and become silent and calm does the machine start talking.
